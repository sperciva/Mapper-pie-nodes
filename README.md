# Mapper-pie-nodes
Implementation of Mapper with pie chart nodes. We use KeplerMapper in Python to generate the graph structure then use d3 in Javascript to produce the graph visualization.

Step 0: Install KeplerMapper with

        pip install kmapper
        
Step 2: Download the two .py files and replace the ones installed on your system in step 1. In Linux, the filepath is something like

        Home/Anaconda3/envs/myenvironment/lib/python3.8/site-packages/kmapper

Step 3: Download the rest of the files and put them in the same directory.

Step 4: Run the Jupyter notebook.

Step 5: Type 

    python3 -m http.server 
    
into a terminal window to start a local server.

Step 6: Go to the URL in the temrinal output (something like http://0.0.0.0:8000/).

Step 7: Navigate to the folder containing the index.html file.
